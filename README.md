# Predict-Future-Inflation
This project, developed with the help of my groupmates for the Introduction to Data Analytics course, focuses on predicting future inflation in the United States using macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, GDP, population, and tax rate data. The goal was to determine whether next-year inflation levels could be forecast with reasonable accuracy using publicly available economic data from sources like the Federal Reserve and Kaggle. We followed the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, including data cleaning, transformation, integration, and predictive modeling using linear and logistic regression. Our final logistic regression model achieved a significant performance improvement over baseline methods, with over 70% accuracy in classifying inflation into actionable categories (low, moderate, and high). This project demonstrates that inflation forecasting is feasible with a modest set of indicators and can potentially inform smarter consumer behavior and policy planning.
Writing the report for our inflation prediction project involved thoroughly documenting each phase of the data analytics process from data collection to model evaluation. We began by outlining the projectâ€™s objective: to predict next-year U.S. inflation based on current-year economic indicators. Each team member contributed to different sections, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and results analysis. The report explains our use of the KDD process, detailing the methods used for cleaning and merging datasets, transforming raw data into usable formats, and evaluating model performance using metrics like MSE, accuracy, and F1-score. We included visualizations and statistical analysis to support our findings, demonstrating how the addition of features like GDP improved predictive accuracy. The final report concludes with insights into the implications of our findings for consumers and the broader economic landscape.
